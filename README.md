## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Kotlin
- **UI Framework:** Jetpack Compose
- **Architecture:** MVVM + Clean Architecture
- **Dependency Injection:** Hilt
- **Networking:** Retrofit & OkHttp
- **Asynchronous Tasks:** Kotlin Coroutines & Flow
- **Background task:** Service

## Architecture

This project follows **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns:

1. **Model**:  
   - Responsible for handling data operations like network calls or database queries.  
   - Example: `Repository` classes.

1. **Domain**:
   - Defines Models and Data repositories  
   - Responsible for handling business logic and use cases.    

2. **ViewModel**:  
   - Acts as a bridge between the `Model` and `View`.  
   - Manages UI-related data and state.  

3. **View**:  
   - Implements the user interface via **Jetpack Compose**.  
   - Observes data changes from the `ViewModel` and renders the UI.

```

- **domain:** Contains core business logic, entities, and use cases.
- **data:** Manages API calls, data caching, and data mapping.
- **presentation:** Handles UI and interaction logic.
- **di:** Dependency injection setup using Hilt.
- **services**: Service is used for background tasks, which is used as a **"Bound Service"** to communicate with UI
